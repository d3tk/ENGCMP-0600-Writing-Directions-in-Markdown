#Introduction
Does your dog bark a lot at around breakfast and dinner time? Is your dog super skinny? Here is a simple solution, **FEED IT**. 
Below are directions in feeding your dog. 

## Warnings
Some dogs bite and that hurts. Try not to get bit.

## Required materials
* Dog (unfed)
* Dog food 
  - Any brand will do. Use your normal brand or a brand reccomended by your Dog's vet. Make sure the dog food is made for the type and age of your dog.
* Hot water (Not boiling but not warm)
* Dog bowl
* Measuring cup for solid ingridients

## Steps
####1. Retrieve your Dog bowl.
####2. Turn on the hot water.
####3. Go to where you store your dog food.
####4. Put dog food in bowl.
  * I give my Dog two cups in the morning (8:00 am).
  * One and a half of a cup at night (8:00 pm).
  ***Note:*** if your dog is on a diet prescribed by your vet, stick to that and ignore my reccomendations 
  my measurements are based on a two year old male English Black Lab, he needs a lot of food.
####5. Return to hot water.
####6. Fill bowl with water.
  * Enough water that the food is submerged.
  * Do not fill to the brim.
####7. If your dog is not near you already, go get them.
####8. Make your dog sit then lay down.
  * This is a form of discipline I use, you do not have to but, it is highly reccomended.
####9. Place the bowl down and **DO NOT** let your dog eat.
  * if your dog tried to eat, pick the bowl up and start at Step 8. again until they do.
####10. Make the dog wait 3 minutes.
####11. Signal to the dog that they may eat.

### Congrats your Dog is now fed!
